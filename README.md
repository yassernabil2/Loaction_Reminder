# Loaction_Reminder
This app allows the user to register and login for creating a list with location reminders that remind him to do something when he is at a specific location.

# User Authentication
Login: Create a Login screen to ask users to login using an email address or a Google account. Upon successful login, navigate the user to the Reminders screen. If there is no account, the app should navigate to a Registration (Signup) screen.
Signup: Create a Registration screen to allow a user to register using an email address or a Google account.
Authentication: Enable the authentication using Firebase console and include Firebase UI dependency in the project. You must use this library, FirebaseUI-Android, to implement the authentication.
Logout: Make sure that the users can log out of the app and when the app starts again they are required to login first.
